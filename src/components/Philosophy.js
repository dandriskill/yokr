      <p>
        <i>Yokr</i> is a simple goal management and personal growth app with a distinct philosophy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Start with 'Why'</h4>
      <p>
        A worthwhile goal has a higher chance of being realized if you first define a clear root motivator. Your <i>root motivator</i> is the reason you do all that you do, the higher purpose that guides your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goals you set should reflect your motivators. Take some time to ponder what truly drives you. Consider whether your current goals are working to fulfill these drivers. Course-correct as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a great root motivator is <i>"To become physically fit and healthy in order to boost my confidence."</i>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Yokr vs. Todo</h4>
      <p>
        A <i>todo</i> is a task. It's an item to be checked off. It may or may not be helping you reach a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <i>yokr</i> isn't a task &mdash; it's a <u>visualization</u> of a specific outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focusing on <i>specific outcomes</i> rather than just 'tasks' provides better context as we make decisions, prioritize, and manage our time. At any time during the process, we can measure our trajectory and course&#8209;correct as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Visualizations</i> increase our motivation to see something through to the end and establish exactly what successful execution looks like. Whether you have succeed or failed in the end will be crystal clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great example of a <i>yokr</i> is <i>"I walk the dog five miles without stopping and break a good sweat. I feel refreshed and happy I did it."</i> This has much more effect than a bland and uninspiring <i>"Walk the dog."</i>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Daily Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Break your efforts into manageable, daily chunks. To focus on doing it 'one day at a time' is not just a saying, but wise counsel given throughout history, because it actually works!
