        <i>Yokr</i> is a simple goal management and personal growth app with a distinct philosophy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Start with 'Why'</h4>
      <p>
        A worthwhile goal has a higher chance of being realized if you first define a clear root motivator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <i>motivator</i> is the reason you do all that you do. It's the higher purpose that guides your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goals you set on Yokr should reflect your motives. Take some time to ponder what truly drives you.
        Consider whether your current goals fulfill your root motivations. Make updates as needed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Yokr vs. Todo</h4>
      <p>
        A todo is a task. It's an item to be checked off. It may or may not be helping you fulfill your ultimate purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <i>yokr</i> is not a task, but a goal for achieving a specific outcome. Thinking in terms of 'outcomes' rather than
        'tasks' leads you to visualize <i>exactly</i> what successful execution looks like. Your level of motivation increases.
        The difference between success and failure becomes crystal clear. At any time during the process, you can measure your
        trajectory and course&#8209;correct if needed. No wonder this style of goal&#8209;setting works so well within teams!
      </p>
      <p>
        With Yokr, you'll define specific goals in the form of detailed <i>visualizations</i>, then the question of what tasks will get you
        there is up to you!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="philo-section">
      <h4>Daily Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Break your efforts into manageable, daily chunks. To focus on doing it 'one day at a time' is not just a saying,
        but wise counsel given throughout history, because it works!
